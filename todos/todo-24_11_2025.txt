- Readme
    - Reasoning for pipeline design choices
    - Make sure to write down thoughts on the steps and where to find it in notebook
        - e.g. we removed blocked reactions instead of setting them to 0,0
            - because time constraints
    - Do this for major steps
    
Benchmark concentration
    - Compare results
        - ~ 5 reactions
    - Compare 3 reactions for time
- Benchmark subset of model
    - 20 - 50 reactions
    - Check results for e.g. 0, 0
    - Make notebook to analyze reaction results
        - How many are blocked
        - Compare flux ranges vs FBA

- Look into biomass transport energy
    - tmodel.reactions.biomass_ce
- rug.smartcat -> check signal
    - Summary paper for Battley 1991

- PTA with Thermo-Flux cobra model
