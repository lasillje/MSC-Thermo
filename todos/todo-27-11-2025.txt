TVFA
    - Normal FBA
    - Run 100 reactions
        - 6 hours max
        - 4 CPUs, 1GB
    - Check TFVA on concentrations
        - If faster, use to constrain TFVA on reactions
    
Biomass reaction
    - Investigate internals

PTA
    - Retrieve annotations from thermoflux
        - get_suitable_ids()
    - Metabolome concentrations
        - Linear normal (mean,std) to 
    - For other concentrations with lb, ubs:
        - Make a log normal distribution
        - Based on lb, ubs
            - Say how big of area these bounds should be of the gaussian
        - OR:
            - Convert to log, then make normal
    - Thermo-flux model
        - Check temp, excel file
        - Set PTA temp to this value
        - Remove fake P compartment
    - Set CO2TOT to hco3
    - Set bounds to FVA
