Flux coupling analysis
    - Cut down number of reactions

PTA from_cobra_model
    - Use thermoflux drG0, (dfG0 not needed)
    - Copy class into seperate module
        - Make adjustments

Plot log values for confirmation
    Look at actual bounds
    For metabolome data
        Enlarge bounds

Use default concentrations from thermo-flux
    For bounds that are not default
        - Set log normal distribution
        - Set frac of area
        - For the ones we have data:
            - 60, 70%
    Metabolites that dont have concentration data

Talk to Arnoud monday

From previous (after checking flux coupling):
    TVFA
    - Normal FBA
    - Run 100 reactions
        - 6 hours max
        - 4 CPUs, 1GB
    - Check TFVA on concentrations
        - If faster, use to constrain TFVA on reactions
